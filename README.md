# A quick readme
I jumped in to revive a stale codebase because league is starting so soon! Original author is MIA, so waiting to hear back for source release details if possible. 

Steps:
1) You're going to want the 'Buttons' folder in the same folder as the exe file. So unzip it if you clones the repo. If you downloaded the zipped release, it should already be good to go.
2) Open up the Setup.ini file in text editor. There's some instructions there and info you need to fill out or else it won't work. Most importantly your poe account name and your POESESSID
3) It assumes the OS is Windows 10 and your filter folder is the default path "Documents\My Games\Path of Exile". I wouldn't mess with the included filter, since it recreates a new filter based on that when updating, and saves it to your filters folder. So you need to refresh the filters in game to see changes.
4) It's not instant. Unfortunately there's going to be some lag between the online stash and the app synchronization. It won't keep up with how quickly you are making exalts.
5) It should work with any screen resolution, but have seen some issues crop up. If you are running two monitors, it is going to show up on Screen 0, so run PoE in Windowed Fullscreen on your primary monitor.
